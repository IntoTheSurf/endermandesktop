                        Alexander "Alex", better known online as Technoblade and most commonly known as Techno,
                        was a Minecraft YouTuber and friend of the Dream Team. </p>
                    <p>
                        There was a running rivalry joke between him and Dream, as they both often competed against each
                        other in competitions. Techno logged on to the Dream SMP for the first time on September 22,
                        2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technoblade made the majority of his videos on the Minecraft server Hypixel. The time range
                        between his video uploads was usually a week to a month, though he had tried (and failed) to do
                        daily episodes. He also streamed Minecraft content live on YouTube, playing on the popular
                        Minecraft server Hypixel, Minecraft Mondays, MC Championship, SMP Earth, Minecraft Story Mode,
                        Party Games and the Dream SMP. </p>
                    <p>
                        He was part of Sleepyboisinc along with Wilbur Soot, Ph1LzA and
                        TommyInnit. He had been nicknamed "The Blade" by Tommy.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        On June 30, 2022, his family released a video announcing that he had passed away due to
                        cancer.

                        Technoblade, also known as Techno, is the twenty-third member of the Dream SMP, joining on
                        September 22, 2020. He is an anarchist opposed to government (as he considers them tyrannical
                        and oppressive) and a co-founder of the Syndicate, a federation dedicated to upholding anarchist
                        ideology. He is known for his dueling skills and prowess in battle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Techno allied with those who promised to help him achieve his goals of anarchy and the
                        eradication of government. He first joined the server at the beginning of the Manberg Rebellion
                        when Wilbur Soot and TommyInnit were exiled from Manberg and began planning to revolt against
                        Jschlatt's rule along with the two by forming the faction Pogtopia. Techno spent weeks gathering
                        resources to aid Pogtopia in removing Jschlatt’s administration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Techno and Pogtopia had a rift
                        after he caused a mass murder during the Manberg Festival, during which he was forced to execute
                        Tubbo. Some members of Pogtopia distrusted Techno, but he continued to aid their cause and
                        encouraged Wilbur to pursue his TNT plot. At the end of the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, when Tubbo
                        was declared the new president of L'Manberg, Techno felt betrayed that Pogtopia had instituted
                        another government in L'Manberg. He spawned two withers and fought against the new
                        administration. The withers, alongside Wilbur's TNT, blew a large crater in L'Manberg. However,
                        the Tubbo Administration quickly began to rebuild L'Manberg. .

                    <p>
                        After the war, Technoblade retired, hurt by Pogtopia's betrayal and the institution of yet
                        another government. He built a cabin in a distant tundra and swore off violence. However, after
                        the Butcher Army attempted to execute him, Techno longed for revenge.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He teamed up with Tommy
                        after Tommy escaped from his exile. Together, they planned to regain the discs and get revenge.
                        Techno then freed Philza, his longtime friend, from house arrest in L'Manberg. Techno admitted
                        his plans to destroy L'Manberg to Tommy, and Tommy agreed to help him; however, Tommy soon
                        rejoined L'Manberg instead. Techno along with Dream and Phil attacked L'Manberg by bombarding it
                        with TNT and withers during the Doomsday War, permanently ending the nation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following the Doomsday War, Ranboo joined Techno and Phil, building his own home nearby. Techno
                        and Phil also founded Syndicate to promote anarchy and diminish tyranny.

                        Quackity & Awesamdude, until being broken out by Phil using the Ender Pearl Stasis Chamber.
                        Following Ranboo’s incarceration, Techno staged a prison break to empty Pandora’s Vault, freeing
                        Dream, ConnorEatsPants, and Ranboo. After Sam killed Ranboo, Techno teamed up with Tubbo,
                        rescuing MICHAEL and imprisoning Sam in Pandora.

                        arch-nemesis, and the main protagonist of the Legacy Arc.

                            would
                            need to acquire this rank, Hypixel responded with 10 million.

                            tryhard his YouTube career even more than usual. Despite not having reached 10 million

                            after Hypixel donated in his Minecraft Monday stream, stating that he would get [PIG]

                            if he'd win the tournament. Following that victory, another plus sign would be added to

                        &SmallCircle; Technoblade once joked about his brother Chris being whitelisted on the Dream SMP
                        and
                        responded to
                        his brother's messages on stream while joking a potential duel between his brother and Drista.
                        After
                        being asked about Chris's age, Techno joked that he didn't know Chris.

                        &SmallCircle;Technoblade was one of the writers of the Dream SMP after Wilbur Soot stepped down.
                        Techno
                        specifically wrote the arc around his character.

                    <p>
                        &SmallCircle;He had "leaked" a fake script on livestream as a joke directed at TommyInnit, who
                        had
                        done the same
                        with an actual script.

                        &SmallCircle; c!Technoblade is presumably in his late 20's, as stated by Wilbur, however at his
                        birthday party
                        he keep his age ambiguous.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &SmallCircle; Although he and Technoblade are still "old friends," Philza has confirmed that the
                        Antarctic
                        Empire lore is NOT linked to the Dream SMP, and is only a headcanon.

                    <p>
                        &SmallCircle; It was previously thought to be canon that his father was Philza. However, when
                        asked on stream
                        he clarified that he does not recognize the family canon, as it's "weird" and makes his
                        backstabbing awkward. He has stated that he is fine with head-canons, but will not be acting out
                        the family dynamics in the story, and it will not be a part of the plot.
                        Phil has also agreed to this, and decanonized the family dynamic, saying that the "longtime
                        friends" plot makes more sense storywise.

                        &SmallCircle; In one stream, he started "memorizing" the layout of the entire server (mostly the
                        areas/terrain that has buildings and landmarks near them) and is called "The Human GPS of the
                        server." This title used to be not fully correct, as he would often "spill his water" and use a
                        transition screen to look at the coordinates of his intended location, but he has since stopped
                        doing this and seems to actually have a good mental map of the layout of the server.

                        &SmallCircle; Technoblade is the only known person to possess Jack 'o' Lantern wearing mobs on
                        the server. He
                        collected them during Halloween and seems to be proud of them.

                        &SmallCircle; During the battle against L'Manberg that occurred on November 16, he used one
                        of
                        the withers to
                        self-promote by naming it "Subscribe to Technoblade" with a name tag. He stated that this
                        was
                        the most important part.

                    <p>
                        &SmallCircle; He has, at one point, stated that his hatred of orphans began when his parents
                        were brutally
                        murdered by a group of orphans. This seems to be the most likely backstory for Technoblade.

                    <p>
                        &SmallCircle; According to Ghostbur's book, Wilbur and Techno used to spar when they were

                        &SmallCircle; According to Technoblade, his second vault contained enough wither heads to
                        create
                        55
                        withers.

                        &SmallCircle; The Butcher Army has put up many posters as propaganda against Technoblade
                        around
                        the SMP, one
                        of which depicts im_a_squid_kid winning the potato war. This seems to imply that the potato
                        war,
                        Hypixel Skyblock, and Squid Kid are all canon to the Dream SMP.

                        &SmallCircle; It was said by Philza that he knew Techno since he was a kid, it might be implied
                        that Philza
                        might have been Techno's mentor.

                        &SmallCircle; Techno in character can perfectly keep track of time, and so can keep track of
                        when to ring his
                        sellout timer.
